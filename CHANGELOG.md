Circle's latest recommendations. It also enhances platform functionality by
enabling data export through dedicated endpoints, allowing users to export
disbursements, payments, and receivers with filters. Additionally, users now

Release of the Stellar Disbursement Platform `v3.0.0`. In this release, receiver
registration does not need to be done exclusively through SMS as it now supports
new types. The options are `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `EMAIL_AND_WALLET_ADDRESS`,
and `PHONE_NUMBER_AND_WALLET_ADDRESS`. If a receiver is registered with a wallet
address, they can receive the payment right away without having to go through
the SEP-24 registration flow.

## [1.0.0.rc1](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-frontend/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1)

### Added

First Release Candidate of the Stellar Disbursement Platform, a tool used to
make bulk payments to a list of recipients based on their phone number and a
confirmation date. This repository is frontend-only, is a client to the backend
version available at [stellar/stellar-disbursement-platform-backend]. Their
version numbers are meant to be kept in sync.

The basic process of this product starts with an organization supplying a CSV
file which includes the recipients' phone number, transfer amount, and essential
customer validation data such as the date of birth.

The platform subsequently sends an SMS to the recipient, which includes a deep
link to the wallet. This link permits recipients with compatible wallets to
register their wallet on the SDP. During this step, they are required to verify
their phone number and additional customer data through the SEP-24 interactive
deposit flow, where this data is shared directly with the backend through a
webpage inside the wallet, but the wallet itself does not have access to this
data.

Upon successful verification, the SDP backend will transfer the funds directly
to the recipient's wallet. When the recipient's wallet has been successfully
associated with their phone number in the SDP, all subsequent payments will
occur automatically.
